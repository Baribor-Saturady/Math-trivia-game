# Math Trivia Game

This project was inspired by the telegram math game bot. It basically asks the user random elementary algebra with a random answer which may or may not be correct. The user is prompted to choose if the answer supplied to the question is correct or wrong within some pre-set seconds serving as a timer. For every failed question, the time alloted for each question is reduced. We hope you enjoy the game.
